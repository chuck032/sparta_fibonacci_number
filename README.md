### Details of this project

For this project I was required to reproduce the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the two previous terms together. The sequence starts with 1 , 2 .

With this in mind I produced the test for the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence. One of the requirements for this project is to use Test Driven Development, so I had to create the tests before developing any code.

These are the steps I took in producing this code:

* Select only the even values of the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence
* Sum of even values of the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci sequence
* Produce a Fibonacci sequence that had its largest term less than 4,000,000
* Select only the even values of this Fibonacci sequence
* Sum of the even values of this Fibonacci sequence

In each of these steps I created the tests before writing any development code.
